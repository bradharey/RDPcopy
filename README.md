# RDPcopy
Copy files via RDP clipboard sync.

These two scripts let you copy files over RDP connection even when the 'Do not allow drive redirection' policy is enabled. This policy makes it impossible to natively copy and paste files from the remote system to the host system.

## How-to:
1. Drag the file onto encode.bat on the remote system
2. Run decode.bat on the local system
3. ???
4. Profit
